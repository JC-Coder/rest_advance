### [**1. Perfect Boilerplate For Starting The Project**](https://github.com/Subham-Maity/auth_advance/tree/2850177ad4eafe1679648ee9bf7140e7b6a1de5b)

  ⁙⫸ This boilerplate is perfect for starting a project without any `schema`, `controller`, `routes`,
  or `authentication`.

#### **Getting Started**:

1. **Setup**: Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the `MONGO_URL=""` with your own MongoDB URL.
2. **Installation**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. **Running the Project**: Use `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the project.

#### **Additional Information**:

  - If any dependency is missing, install it manually.
  - If any dependency needs to be updated, update it manually or use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to check the
  outdated dependencies. Then use `npm update` or `yarn update` to update the dependencies.
  - You can change the port number in the `.env` file as per your requirements.

### [**2. Cookie-based Proper Authentication with Server Token (Stateful)**]()


⁙⫸ With Authentication + User Operations

#### **Contents**:

- **User Schema (Mongoose)**: Includes `email`, `username`, and `authentication` (which consists of `password`, `salt`,
  and `sessionToken`).
- **User Type Defined**
- **Middleware**: This includes two types:
    - **Owner**: Ensures the user is the owner of the account.
    - **Authenticated**: Ensures the user is authenticated.
    - **Error Handler**: Handles the error.
- **Utils**: This includes crypto for salt and hash password and generate session token.
- **Controller**: This includes `auth` (with `register` and `login` methods) and `User` (
  with `getAllUser`, `updateUserById`, and `deleteUserById` methods).

#### **Routes**:

- **Auth**
    - `register`: POST request to `http://localhost:{your_port}/api/v1/auth/register`
        - Example body:
      ```json
      {
        "email": "subham@gmail.com",
        "password": "Subham@123#86!GitHub_DeVeLoPeR",
        "username": "Subham"
      }
      ```
    - `login`: POST request to `http://localhost:{your_port}/api/v1/auth/login`
        - Example body:
      ```json
      {
        "email": "subham@gmail.com",
        "password": "Subham@123#86!GitHub_DeVeLoPeR",
        "username": "Subham"
      }
      ```
- **User**
    - `getAllUser`: GET request to `http://localhost:{your_port}/api/v1/users`. This is wrapped with
      the `authentication` middleware, so you need to log in first to get the data.
    - `updateUserById`: PATCH request to `http://localhost:{your_port}/api/v1/users/{id}`. This is wrapped with
      the `authentication` and `owner` middleware, so you need to log in first to update the data.
        - Example body:
      ```json
      {
        "username": "XAM"
      }
      ```
    - `deleteUserById`: DELETE request to `http://localhost:{your_port}/api/v1/users/{id}`. This is wrapped with
      the `authentication` and `owner` middleware, so you need to log in first to delete the data.
